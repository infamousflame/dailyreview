         <h2 id="About_Me">About Me</h2>
             <p>Hello, I am Owen Levin, and I am a 
             sophomore at Patino School of Entrepreneurship. Most of my skills lie 
             in my programming expertise , I have been programming for about 4 years,
             and am fairly fluent in a couple of languages. The programming languages 
             that I understand are python, html, css, and some javascript. My strongest
             language by far is Java, this is the language that I have spent the most amount
             of time learning, and is the language that I am the most familiar with. I use this
             language in order to make games and apps for the android app store (Which I have a 
             developer account for). I am capable of learning programming languages at very fast 
             rates and am looking for people who can help me make a game company. I would need people
             who are able to market my game, people who are able to handle the finances, and people who
             are skilled in arts such as sound design and graphic design. I would be a very big asset for
             a company because of all of my years of experience within the field of programming.</p>
             
             <p>The majority of my skill lie within the time that I have invested into learning different programming languages. 
             I am currently working on making a video game with some of my dear friends, and am getting first hand experience in that aspect.
             I am also able to make applications for the android app store, and can learn how to make apps for the apple store if neccisarry.
             I am also able to make a working, and hopefully with experience, beautiful website. 
             These skills will be very important for my team, because I am probably one of the most seasoned programmers in this school.</p>
